No, you can use ReLUs after fully-connected layers as well.
Usually, the ReLU activation is the most preferred in neural nets.
You can find the detailed differences about these activation functions at -

Yes, dropout is only used during training.
You shouldn't use it while validating / testing your model.
You can find a detailed explanation at -

Ideally, you should be testing out your model with both the grayscale as well as the colored images, 
and then choose the one that performs better. Does this answer your question?
