    "**Q1:Suppose you have a pedestrian state X. I want you to compare two scenarios: in the first predict the state 0.1s into the future and in the second 5s into the future. Which of these two scenarios leads to a higher uncertainty? In answering this, consider whether or not random noise has an increasing effect with increasing gaps between prediction times.**\n",
    "\n",
    ">A1:A time difference of 5s leads to a higher uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Here's another way of thinking about it: if you split the 5s time difference into several intermediate predictions with a difference of 0.1s, then compared to the first case, you will predict the same state many more times without receiving any feedback about the object's new position. Thus, the uncertainty increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2:Let's say we use our linear motion model with fixed time increments, but the pedestrian is randomly changing her velocity (accelerating), sometimes speeding up, slowing down or changing direction. However, the overall mean change is zero. This introduces a noise in the tracking process - what kind of noise is it?**\n",

    ">A1:Process noise\n",
    "\n",
    ">The prediction equation treats the pedestrian's velocity as constant. As such, a randomly accelerating pedestrian creates a process noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From the examples Iâ€™ve just showed you we can clearly see that the process noise depends on both: the elapsed time and the uncertainty of acceleration. So, how can we model the process noise by considering both of these factors? Keep going to find out :)\n",
